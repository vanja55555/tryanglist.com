  We all have a real mixture of psychological traits, but we also share
  similarities with other people. This research was conducted to find how people
  with specific psychology characteristics react to COVID-19. Who are they, what
  are they like  and - what are they afraid of the most?

2020 has been marked by Coronavirus, that has impacted our lives in many different ways. 

This research was conducted to explore how different psychological traits affect perceptions about our current situation: we are all worried about something, but we also have different perspectives. 

511 people were surveyed and grouped into 3 segments based on what they care and worry about. 

One group, Relaxed Players, is the least worried about spreading the virus - this can be a good indication for future interventions.

However, this is also an invitation for everyone to reflect on their own traits and needs during these trying times. 

Which group do you relate the most?
