  2020 has been marked by Coronavirus, that has impacted our lives in many
  different ways. 


  This research was conducted to explore how different psychological traits
  affect perceptions about our current situation: we are all worried about
  something, but we also have different perspectives. 

  511 people were surveyed and grouped into 3 segments based on what they care
  and worry about. 

  One group, in particular, is the least worried about spreading the virus. This
  can be a good indication for future interventions.

  However, this is also an invitation for everyone to reflect on their own
  traits and needs during these trying times. Which group do you relate the
  most?
