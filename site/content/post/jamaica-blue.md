Years ago I was working in marketing team for a film distributor.

When I look back at that time, I don’t remember what I did, I don’t remember how long I stayed, in fact I don’t remember anything in particular, but I do remember – her.

Actually, it would be an understatement to say - this was the most memorable person I have ever met.

Seemingly there was nothing special about her and yet - everything about her was special.

When she spoke to you she would make you feel like you are the most interesting person in the world and yet she always had this aura of exclusivity.

Everything about her was cool - the way she would do a mini dance whilst sitting at her desk and listening to strange music like nobody was watching; the way she was holding a cigarette; even the way she expressed herself unapologetically.

I never knew what her job title was, but between her witty emails and adorable laugher, no one even bothered to ask.

_After all she would connect us to many important people._

It seemed that her charm had a radius way bigger than the boundaries of our little office.

We were all was madly in love with her.

_But we were also mad._

None of my co-workers could understand what was so special about her - what made her shine.

I was no exception. But as I always wanting to dissect things and measure, I wanted to break it all down and understand what was it exactly what makes a difference between her and me.

After all, she was not too different to me: similar age and height, similar sense of humour, coming from the same country and I guess I could listen to some strange music in the office - it’s just no one ever cared if I did.



The answer to my question came to me years later as I was working on a branding project.

I finally get it.

She was not different to me.

She was more than different.

She was distinct.

If she was a brand she would be a distinctive brand and brands like this don’t ever measure up on the same criteria.

They don’t follow the same rules as anyone else.

They don’t even follow different rules.

They make their own rules and have their own playground.



## **Brands can be different in my ways: some brands have a blue logo, some have a pink one.**

Then there are some brands that don’t have a logo at all - like Marlboro that used only their colours on Ferrari Formula One cars.

Simply seeing the red and white combination of colours triggers the cigarette cravings in the brains of smokers.

Therefore, some brands are simply distinctive and compete in their own competitive-less marketplace (and undoubtedly - enjoy all the benefits from that!).



Being distinctive is not necessarily easy; you need to be lucky to stumble across an idea or work hard to create something new.

But the good news is that this is not the only way distinctiveness is made.



I will never forget the interview Tim Ferris made with Bill Watersone, the author of Kelvin and Hobbes.

Bill said he always wanted to be a painter, but his drawing skills were not good enough.

He always wanted to be a comedian, but his comedy was not good enough.

So he combined the two - drawing and comedy and became the world's most famous - comic strip cartoonist.

He created his own distinctiveness through a combination of two more-than-average skills.

Combining things that seemingly have no connection at all is not a new concept either. 

In fact, check out the way some people combine poetry and maths:

This was what my colleague did as well.

She was not the most Bosnian person in a foreign country, she was not the coolest, funniest or the most beautiful woman. 

But she was a combination of many characteristics that ultimately made the synergy.



So there she was - shining whilst enjoying her 100% distinctiveness in a marketplace that was completely her own.



And being memorable because of it.
