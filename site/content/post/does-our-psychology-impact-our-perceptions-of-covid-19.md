  2020 has been marked by Coronavirus, that has impacted our lives in many
  different ways. This research was conducted to find how people with different
  psychological traits relate to our current situation: we are all worried about
  something, but we also have different perspectives. 511 people were surveyed
  and grouped into 3 segments based on what they care and worry about. This can
  be an implication for interventions as one group, in particular, is the least
  worried about spreading the virus. However, this is also an invitation for
  everyone to reflect on their own traits and needs during these trying times.
