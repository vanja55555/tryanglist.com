title: Does our psychology impact our perceptions of COVID-19?

  Our psychological traits impact our behaviour and things are not different
  during the time of Coronavirus. We are all worried about something, but we
  also have different priorities. 511 people were surveyed during COVID-19 and
  they were grouped into 3 segments based on what they care and worry about.
  This can be an implication for interventions as one group, in particular, is
  the least worried about spreading the virus. However, this is also an
  invitation for everyone to reflect on their own traits and needs during these
  trying times.
